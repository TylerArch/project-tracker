# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler


## Description
The motivation for this project was to create a  project tracker to incorporate the new elements of JavaScript and CSS frameworks that I have learned. I incorporated loops, Event Listeners, Local Storage interaction, and bootstrap to accomplish this. I heavily expanded on my JavaScript funtionality and am very happy with the result.

## Installation

Right clicking on the index.html and selecting "Open in default browser" will open the browser and  navigate to the Portfolio page.

## Usage

Clicking on an event field allows you to enter the details for an upcoming event. I was unable to complete the functionality of it due to illness but I will be woirking to finish in the next couple days.

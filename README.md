# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler


## Description
The motivation for this project was to create a  project tracker to incorporate the new elements of JavaScript and CSS frameworks that I have learned. I incorporated loops, Event Listeners, Local Storage interaction, and bootstrap to accomplish this. I heavily expanded on my JavaScript funtionality and am very happy with the result.

## Installation

Right clicking on the index.html and selecting "Open in default browser" will open the browser and  navigate to the Portfolio page.

## Usage

Clicking on an event field allows you to enter the details for an upcoming event. The time block will also light up gray to show if the event is in the past, green to show if the event is in the future, and red to show if the event is in the present hour. The evnts also remain when the page is refreshed.
